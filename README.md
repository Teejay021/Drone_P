# Drone Control Web Application

## Project Overview
This web application offers manual control of a ground-based reconnaissance drone, inspired by the Rainbow Six Siege drones. Users can create accounts via email or OAuth services (Google, GitHub, Meta), and save and retrieve images captured by the drone.

## Features
- **Live Video Streaming**: Real-time video feed from the drone's onboard camera.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login via email or OAuth.
- **Image Capture & Retrieval**: Store and access images through user accounts.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux for state management.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful APIs.
- **Database**: MongoDB for persisting user data and media.
- **Raspberry Pi Integration**: Flask server manages video feed and GPIO-based control for motors and camera.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS for hosting the app and storing image data.

## Collaboration
Multidisciplinary project combining software development and mechanical design to build a responsive, controllable ground reconnaissance unit.
